        <h4>Privacy Statement</h4>
        <p>
            As somebody who is very privacy-oriented, I tried to design this site to collect as little information as possible.
            <b>I do not collect any emails, phone numbers or other identifiable information, because I don't need to.</b>
            Below is a summary of the (minimal) information PMReferrals tracks.
        </p>
        <h5>User Information</h5>
        <p>
            When you create an account, the website stores your username and a password hash <b>(not your real password)</b>.
            It also stores some meta data about your account, such as your "boost" score and session ID.
            PMReferrals accounts do not require an email or phone number, and as such cannot be used to identify the user.
        </p>
        <h5>User Activity</h5>
        <p>
            The website maintains an aggregated list of daily statistics regarding the number of codes viewed and submitted, 
            and the times those events occurred. These statistics don't contain any user information.
        </p>
        <h5>Cookies</h5>
        <p>
            This website uses just one cookie, and it contains nothing but a randomly generated session ID to ensure 
            that you stay logged in. The session ID is randomized every time you log in, and accessed on each page load
            (the navbar depends on it).
            The cookie expires one week after the most recent login.
        </p>
        <h5>Tracking and Fingerprinting</h5>
        <p>
            The website does not currently use any fingerprinting techniques to identify anonymous users.
            <b>It does not keep records of IP addresses.</b>
            However, in the near future I will need to ensure that sharable links are not abused by the owner for a higher rank.
            At that point I will disclose the techniques I decide to use to accomplish this.
